# MAGIC Infra
# MAGIC - DBX ML Runtime: 14.2.x-gpu-ml-scala2.12
# MAGIC - Worker type: Standard_NC8as_T4_v3
# MAGIC   - 56GB RAM
# MAGIC   - 1 GPU (NVIDIA T4)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - `flash-attn-2` may not work on this GPU, will either not use it, upgrade to newer GPU or downgrade package version
# MAGIC - also, T4 does not support `bf16`, so `fp16` will need to be set for anything related to quantization
